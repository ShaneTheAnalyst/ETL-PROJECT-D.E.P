# ETL-PROJECT-D.E.P
In this ETL project, we will design and implement a data pipeline utilizing Apache Airflow for orchestration. The pipeline will extract data on engineering books from Amazon, transform it as required, and load the processed data into a PostgreSQL database. This pipeline will be scheduled to run at regular intervals, automating extraction process.
